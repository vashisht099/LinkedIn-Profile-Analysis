## Project Highlights
- Data Collection: I used the LinkedIn API to gather data from my profile, including connection details, job history, education, skills, and endorsements.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Raw data often contains inconsistencies and missing values. I performed thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accurate analysis results.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through EDA, I visualized key metrics such as the distribution of my connections, the frequency of skills, and the growth of my network over time.

- Network Analysis: I conducted a network analysis to understand the structure of my LinkedIn connections. This analysis involved identifying influential connections, communities, and common connections among them.

- Skills Assessment: Using the data on endorsed skills, I assessed the top skills associated with my profile and their relative strengths.
